\title{ARMv8 AArch64 Emulator Checkpoint Report}
\author{Team 54}

\maketitle

\section{Group Organisation and Workflow}
\label{sec:group-organisation}

Our group used a structured workflow and leveraged Git with dedicated \texttt{feat/} branches and frequent stub implementations to maintain code quality and compilation. Commit messages followed an imperative format with contributor shortcodes. Every new feature created a GitLab merge request which was reviewed and approved by a separate team member to uphold coding standards.

\subsection{Division of Labour for Emulator (Part I)}
The emulator development was systematically divided into four core components, ensuring balanced responsibilities across the team:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em,noitemsep, itemsep=0.5em, parsep=0em]
    \item \textbf{Jai -- Core System \& I/O:}\\
    Established the emulator's core infrastructure by defining \texttt{ARMState} (registers, PC, PSTATE, memory), initialising its state, implementing the binary file loader, and managing the main execution loop, including command-line parsing, halt instruction, and final output.
    \item \textbf{Richard -- Instruction Decoding \& Bitwise Utilities:}\\
    Led instruction decoding by developing bit extraction utilities, defining C structures (\texttt{\seqsplit{instruction\_types.h}}) for decoded instructions, implementing \texttt{decode\_instruction}, and creating helpers for \texttt{PSTATE} flag updates and register ID mapping.
    \item \textbf{Prasanna -- Data Processing Instructions Execution:}\\
    Implemented the execution logic for all data processing instructions (arithmetic, wide moves, logical, multiplies), developed underlying bitwise shift functions, and integrated \texttt{PSTATE} flag updates.
    \item \textbf{Zayan -- Memory \& Control Flow Instructions Execution:}\\
    Implemented memory access and control flow instructions, including single data transfers (\texttt{ldr}, \texttt{str}) with all addressing modes and load/store size handling, and developed all branch instructions for PC modification, offset calculations, and conditional execution. \todo{For Part III, Zayan will integrate GPIO memory write detection here.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Group Progress and Communication}
\label{sec:group-progress}

Our group is working well together thus far, showing strong individual performance as well as good mutual support. We have elected Jai as our group leader, to manage the workflow and decide how the project will be split between members of the group. Initially, we split the emulator task into 4 roughly equal components and developed group standards for git commit messages, branch names, and comment styles. Communicating through a Slack channel, we organise frequent meetings (approximately every other day) to ensure that each team member is continuing to stay on track with their assigned work. A key practice for us has been to pair up for merge commits so that we can peer review eachother’s code for quality and catch any potential issues. 

For later parts of the project, we can see our current communication standards continuing majorly as they are. We feel that in future tasks (the assembler and extension) there will be more interdependencies on eachother’s code, so integration tasks will pose a greater challenge, yet we feel confident that our established communication standards and peer review process should suffice.

\section{Emulator Structure and Reusability}
\label{sec:emulator-structure}
\todo{This section will detail the high-level architecture of the emulator. How are the fetch, decode, and execute phases structured? Discuss the main data structures (e.g., how ARMState is used) and functions. Highlight parts of the emulator's design or code that you anticipate will be reusable for the assembler (e.g., register parsing logic, understanding instruction formats). Keep this to 1-2 paragraphs.}

\section{Challenges and Mitigation}
\label{sec:challenges}
\todo{This section will outline specific technical or collaborative challenges encountered during the emulator's implementation. Examples might include: complex bitwise operations, handling endianness, debugging specific instruction types, or integrating different team members' code. For each challenge, explain your approach to mitigate it. For example, "Understanding ARMv8's shifting rules was challenging, mitigated by extensive diagramming and small-scale test cases." Keep this to 1-2 paragraphs.}
